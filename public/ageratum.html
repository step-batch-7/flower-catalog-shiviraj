      Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and
      warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
      Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central America
      and Mexico but four are native to the United States. They form tussocks or
      small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The opposite leaves are
      cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or
      serrate. The leaves form compact clusters. The fluffy flowers are
      lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in small compound umbels.
      They give small, dry fruits.
